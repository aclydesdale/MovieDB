# MovieDB

## Overview
Simple web app which displays movies by genre using TheMovieDB API.

## Usage
* Create a config.json file which includes your api_key. API key can be found at [TheMovieDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org).
* Add your API key within the FilmByGenre.js file.
* Run the project in a web server which supports PHP 7, I recommend [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org).

**Please Note: This is not a secure way to handle secret API keys. Please only use this project in a personal environment.**

## What I Learned
* Using a third party REST API web service.
* Use of AJAX calls to make API requests.
